Set up a LAMP Stack:

- For this task, we will be using RockyLinux on VirtualBox

Install Apache Package
- We need to install the Apache Package
- It is important to update the OS before we do this
- Open terminal
- Type: sudo dnf update -y
- Now that the OS is updated, we can install the Apache httpd web server package from the Rocky App stream
	- Type: sudo dnf install httpd
- We must start the httpd service after installing the apache web server package
- Type:
	- sudo systemctl start httpd
	  - Used to start the httpd daemon
	- sudo systemctl enable httpd
		- Used to start the apache service during reboot
	- sudo systemctl status httpd
		- Used to verify the status of Apache server (Active or disabled)
		- We can press Q to get out of this
-  We will now need to open up the firewall port for HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) services
	- As soon as the ports are open, the public will be able to access our website
- Type:
	- sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp
	- sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp
	- sudo firewall-cmd --reload
- We can use the following command to display all of the info available in the default zone file:
	- sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
- When we run this, we notice the following in the info:
	- ports: 80/tcp 443/tcp
- Now we can verify and confirm that the installed Apache service is active and running
- Open a browser and enter the IP address on the server
	- If we get a page that says "HTTP Server Test Page" then we it is a success

Install MySQL / MariaDB Server
- We are going to do MariaDB
- To install,
	- Type: sudo dnf install mariadb-server
- Now that it is installed, we run the following commands to start MariaDB on every reboot:
	- sudo systemctl start mariadb
	- sudo systemctl enable mariadb
	- sudo systemctl status mariadb
- Make sure it is active (running)
- It is good practice to run the security script that comes with MariaDB to strengthen security
- Type: sudo mariadb-secure-installation
- We can add a password in this prompt
- For the rest, type Y which will do the following:
	- Remove anonymous user
	- Block root user from logging in
	- Remove test database
- We can now login to the MariaDB sever
	- Type: mysql -u root -p
- Once we have successfully logged in, we will see the MariaDB prompt
	- Type: quit

Install PHP:
- We can check the available PHP versions in Rocky Linux before installing
	- Type: sudo dnf module list php
- This will indicate that our OS (Rocky Linux 9.1) includes the PHP 8.1 version as the default PHP stream
- Activate PHP 8.1
	- Type: sudo dnf module enable php:8.1
- Running the following command again will show as that PHP version 8.1 is enabled:
	- Type: sudo dnf module list php
- Type the following to install PHP and all the dependencies of several PHP module along with the main PHP package:
	- sudo dnf install php php-cli php-gd php-curl php-zip php-mbstring php-mysqlnd -y
- Verify the PHP version
	- Type: php -v
- Now the Apache Web Server needs to be restarted so that PHP requests can be processed
	- Type: sudo systemctl restart httpd
- PHP can be tested in a web browser by creating a file named info.php
	- info.php should be placed in the document root of Apache (/var/www/html)
	- Type: sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
		- <?php
		  phpinfo();
		 ?>
	- Save: Ctrl + O
		- Enter
	- Ext: Ctrl + X
- Restart Apache
	- Type: sudo systemctl restart httpd
- Test the info.php file in browser
	- http://server_ip/info.php
- A table should pop up with the info
- Once debugging is complete, delete info.php from server
